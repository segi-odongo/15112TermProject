# 15112TermProject
This project is for my 15-112 (Foundations of Computer Programming) class. This project impliments openCV in order to map a users body on to a 2d screen and allow them to juggle a soccer ball. This is designed entirely in python and tkinter.
In order to run this file you just need to run it in any IDE. However, you need to have openCV installed (pip3 install opencv-python) and have mediapipe installed (pip3 install mediapipe). (Note you also need numpy installed but its included in the install of mediapipe and openCV)
